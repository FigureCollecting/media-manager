"""The media.v1 replay: the media DB's clean copies and masks, reported to the
spine over SpineMedia (``python -m app.cli.mask_report``; MM-REPORT-1,
fc-aggregation DEPLOY.md section 4 (a)).

THE PLAN, read from the media DB. Every ORIGINAL behind a LIVE clean copy
(``sanitized`` public object; live as app.publication.images_behind judges
it: its version and every image behind it not soft-deleted), mapped to one
copy: the copy minted from that image, else the lowest-addressed copy it is
linked behind. Every mask row with bytes, judged per MASK BYTES, as the
origin serves them: PUBLISHED when some ``ok`` row of a live copy carries
them; otherwise WITHDRAWN -- a ``withdrawn`` row with its reason and instant,
or an ``ok`` row of a dead copy (reason ``deleted``, as
app.publication.mask_refusal says). ``held`` and other rows are never sent.
A published row whose mask bytes have no ``mask`` public object is never
reported (the origin would answer 404 for it): it is refused locally by name
(``mask_object``).
Store eligibility is NOT re-judged here: run ``masks reevaluate --apply``
first, as for the origin.

PER BATCH of at most 200 originals, in sha order:
  1. LeasePendingImages{origin_sha256: the batch}, repeated until the batch's
     pending depictions are drained. Every returned origin_sha256 is checked
     against the batch. Anything else means the spine is not honouring the
     filter (a server before 0.10.0 ignores it): a DEPLOYMENT FAULT. The
     batch's own depictions in that answer are reported, the strays are left
     to lapse, and the run STOPS (exit 3) rather than walk the shared queue.
  2. ReportDerivative for each depiction: the clean copy, its mime and size,
     the clean pipeline's version, its instant, and its own appearance
     (thumbhash, dominant colour; a grounding only for a transparent copy).
  3. ReportMask for each published mask row of the copies whose LAST
     original is in this batch (so their derivatives have been reported).
     FAILED_PRECONDITION (no derivative registered for the copy): when this
     run reported that derivative it is retried, and if it persists the mask
     is ``unregistered`` (exit 1); when no original of the copy had a
     depiction to lease (the spine never captured it, or it is suppressed)
     it is an ``orphan``: expected, counted, the originals named in the
     batch line, never a failure.
  4. A restore (WithdrawMask restore=true) for each published mask whose
     withdrawal this replay once sent (``spine_mask_withdrawals``).
  5. WithdrawMask for each withdrawn mask, recorded in
     ``spine_mask_withdrawals`` BEFORE the call.
A last TAIL batch carries the copies no original planned (dead copies): their
withdrawals only.

IDEMPOTENT AND RESUMABLE. Every call is retry-safe by contract, so a rerun
stores nothing new. The run ledger is ``spine_report_runs``: the cursor is
the last original of the last finished batch. Before EVERY lease call
(each round of a batch), ``resume_not_before`` is set and committed to when
that call's hold will have lapsed, whichever attempt inside it takes it: the
lease seconds asked for, a margin, and the call's worst case (every attempt
at its deadline and every backoff). Once the call has answered or failed it
is set again, from that instant. It is cleared when the batch finishes. A run
that stops mid-batch -- a fatal status, a spine that stays down, a lease with
a failed attempt (which may hold rows a retry cannot see), or a killed pod --
leaves it set, and the rerun waits for it before it
leases that batch again: a held depiction is invisible to a lease, and
reading that as "nothing pending" would skip it.

Exit status: 0 done; 1 done, but not everything landed (a spine refusal, a
value the field rule would not send, a mask with no public object, or an
``unregistered`` mask); 3 stopped, resumable (rerun); 2 is the CLI's (bad
arguments). Exit 1 is read from the run's PERSISTED counts, so a resumed run
reports what an earlier attempt of it could not land. Orphans never make it 1.

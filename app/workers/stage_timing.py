"""One image's seconds by stage (MASK-PERF-1): where the mask batch's time goes.

The mask batch (app.cli.mask_batch) times every image's stages with its own
injectable clock and reports their means and medians per chunk. A stage is a
context manager around the code it times: it reads the clock on the way in
and out and lets every exception through untouched, so timing never changes
an answer, an order or a transaction.

A stage inside another counts only in the inner one (the outer keeps its own
seconds), so the stages of an image add up to the time spent in them, each
second once. The database's seconds are timed by SQLAlchemy's events instead
(DatabaseSeconds): every statement, commit and rollback, whichever stage runs
it, counted once under "db" by the same rule.

Pipelined (MASK-PERF-2), each image runs on a worker thread of its own with
a session of its own, and its stages are its own wall time: the waits the
pipeline adds are stages too ("claim", "gpu_wait", "turn_wait"), and what a
read-ahead thread measured for it is added (``StageTimings.add``).

    It listens on the session and its engine from construction to ``close``
    and only reads the clock: no statement, result, transaction or error
    changes. A statement is timed from ``before_execute`` and a commit from
    ``before_commit``, so a listener another added earlier runs inside them

    from its cursor run). What no event spans stays in the stage around it:
    the pool's checkout (its pre-ping is a SELECT 1 straight on the DBAPI
    cursor) and a session rollback's own work (it expires all it holds). The
    batch's "db" stages around a transaction's first query and around each
    rollback hold those.

    Pipelined (MASK-PERF-2), ``sessions`` makes each worker's session: its
    sessions are listened to as well, and each thread charges its own image

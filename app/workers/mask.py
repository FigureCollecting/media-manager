"""MASK-1: the separate alpha mask and the grounding numbers, per clean image.

Ross 2026-09-26: background removal is a NON-DESTRUCTIVE, display-time
overlay. The clean copy (the sanitized derivative) is stored and served
byte-for-byte as it is; this module computes a SEPARATE mask -- our own work
product -- that the client composites over it (CSS ``mask-image`` in alpha
mode, or canvas ``destination-in``), so the case shows through around the
figure. A destructive cut-out stays only as Ross's fallback
(``app.workers.tasks._create_matted_derivative``).

THE MASK FILE. fc-api-contract 0.4.0 ``ImageMask``: same pixel dimensions as
its derivative, ``image/png``, "its alpha channel is the mask". It is one
channel of information carried as PNG ``LA``: luminance is constant white and
alpha is the mask, so a client compositing in alpha mode reads the mask and
one compositing in luminance mode reads ``1.0 x alpha`` -- the same mask. A
grayscale ``L`` PNG would carry no alpha and mask nothing.

THE NUMBERS. Grounding is measured on the mask's alpha (opaque = alpha above
10 of 255, the contract's rule); the appearance (ThumbHash and dominant
color) is computed twice, with the mask applied and without it, because the
coordinator must describe the image "as THIS caller is shown it" and a
``no_mask`` display restriction withholds the mask (catalog.proto DISPLAY
RESTRICTIONS). The lane never decides who sees what; it only stores both.

THE QUALITY GATE. A mask that removed (almost) nothing (``full_frame``), or
that kept the backdrop's floor (``bottom_edge_bleed``: see _kept_floor) is
HELD: computed and kept for review, never published. The floor case is the
black-dress-on-black-marble failure the base-keep pass can produce; it is
reproduced synthetically by the sample's ``madoka-black-dress`` entry. (The
July file fc-design-assets/madoka-matte-basekept.png is NOT that failure:
measured 2026-10-11 its alpha covers 34 % of the frame and its lowest row is
41 rows above the bottom edge.) The gate catches a floor kept ALONG THE
BOTTOM EDGE; a floor that stops short of the edge, or that is under 85 %
opaque on every row of the band, is not detected. A mask with nothing opaque
is EMPTY and nothing is stored. Only an ``ok`` mask is ever addressable.

"""MM-CAPS-1: the explicit limits every original passes before anything decodes it.

An original reaches the clean-copy step from the raw bucket as stored bytes (maybe gzip). Until this module the
only guards between those bytes and a full decode were Pillow's DEFAULT pixel guard (which only WARNS between its
bound and twice it) and nothing at all on the gzip step: ``gzip.decompress`` of a bomb allocates whatever it expands
to. The gallery download (MFC-GALLERY-2) puts hundreds of thousands of files through this path, so the bound is
stated, not assumed:

* ``max_bytes``          the stored original, before anything opens it. 32 MiB: the scraper's own capture cap
                         (imageBytes.ts DEFAULT_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES), so nothing it stored is refused for size.
* ``max_pixels``         width x height read from the HEADER (Pillow's open reads the header only; no pixel is
                         decoded to learn the size). 64 megapixels.
* ``max_decoded_bytes``  the memory the clean-copy step would need: at least the RGBA working copy
                         (4 bytes a pixel) or the mode's own depth if deeper. 256 MiB.
* ``gunzip_capped``      the gzip step stops at its output cap instead of expanding a bomb.

A refusal is an :class:`ImageLimitError` with a stable ``code`` (the batch records it as ``refused:<code>``: the
image's own fault, never an outage). An image these limits do not concern, including one Pillow cannot read at all,
is left to fail where it always did. Each limit can be set by environment (``MM_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES``,
``MM_MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS``, ``MM_MAX_DECODED_BYTES``); a value that is not a positive integer keeps the default.

NOT here: the rest of the image track's I8 contract (a format allow-list, verify-then-reopen). This is the
decompression-bomb gate that has to stand before any bulk run.

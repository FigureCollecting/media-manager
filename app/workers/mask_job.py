"""MASK-1 batch job: masks for every clean image that has none yet.

DRY RUN BY DEFAULT. A dry run computes everything -- eligibility, the mask,
its grounding -- and reports it, but writes nothing: no object, no row, no
batch record. ``dry_run=False`` is the only way anything is stored, and it
refuses a backend that is not a mask model (``publishes_masks``; the stub,
which is also the configured default) before writing anything: a stub mask
would otherwise be published and, being a result, settle its image for good.

IDEMPOTENT. A clean image is selected only while it has no image_masks row
at the current MASK_PIPELINE_VERSION, so a re-run is a no-op and a version
bump selects everything again (the old masks stay addressable). Mask bytes
are content-addressed, so two images with the same mask share one object.
Every capture of a picture is linked behind every clean copy of it
(app.workers.mask_seed): a copy is judged over every image behind it
(app.publication) and waits while any is soft-deleted.

RESUMABLE. Each clean image is settled in its own transaction -- its object
written first, then its row, its public registration and the batch's cursor
and counts committed together -- so a killed worker loses at most the image
in flight. ``resume_batch_id`` continues a batch that never finished from
its cursor (candidates are taken in sha order, a keyset rather than an
offset, so nothing is skipped or seen twice).

FAILURES are per image -- in the judgment as in the mask -- recorded as
``failed`` with the exception's CLASS only (never a message, which can carry
a bucket or key), and re-driven with ``retry_failed=True``. An
``ineligible`` image is re-judged with ``recheck_ineligible=True`` (a store
granted later, origins that changed). An image soft-deleted after the batch
selected it is ``skipped`` (reason ``deleted``) and nothing is recorded, so
restoring it makes it a candidate again.

RE-EVALUATION. ``reevaluate_masks`` re-judges every published (``ok``) and
``withdrawn`` row against its image's current state (app.publication): the
origin already refuses such a mask on every request; this keeps the lane's
own record in line and restores a mask whose image qualifies again.
